# This is a example how Space Heating and Domestic Hot Water (DHW) can be modeled 
# Both technologier inherent flexibility which is incentivized by a dynamic electricity price
# The model is based on a single family house with a heat pump for space heating and DHW
# The optimization duration is one day with 15 minute time steps

parameters:
# Parameters for space heating 
  gfa: 120 # Gross Floor Area in m²
  cw: 0.08 # specific heat capacity of bricks in kWh/(m²*K)
  sh_ub: 23 # assuming allowed room temperature ranges between 19 and 23 degrees Celsius
  sh_lb: 19 # lower bound for space heating temperature in degrees Celsius
# Parameters for Domestic Hot Water (DHW)
  delta_dhw_tank: 10 # assuming a temperature difference of 10 K for the DHW tank
  cp: 1.16 # specific heat capacity of water kWh/(kg*K)
