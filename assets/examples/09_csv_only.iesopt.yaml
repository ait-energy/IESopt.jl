  # You could either do the following:
  #   - connections.csv
  #   - nodes.csv
  #   - profiles.csv
  #   - units.csv
  # If you do that, change `components: files` to `components: files/09` in the `paths` section, to correctly include
  # the "09/" folder into the filepath.

  # Or "better", load all CSV files in "09/" except "snapshots.csv":
  - ^09[/\\]((?!snapshots\.csv$).)*\.csv$
  # NOTE: It is recommended to use `[/\\]` as path separators, like in the Regex above,
  #       so the model can work on both UNIX and Windows systems.

  # You can also use `- .csv` to load all CSV files in the folder.

# Even when loading components from external CSV files, you can specify additional ones like normal. IESopt takes
# care about merging them correctly.
