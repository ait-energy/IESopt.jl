# NOTE:
#   - The `|` at the start indicates in the YAML that what follows will be a multi-line string.
#   - You can use `this.get("...")` to access any parameter known in this template.
#   - Accessing `wacc` is possible since it is NOT a parameter of this template AND is a known template in the global
#     parameters defined in the top-level config file (these are "passed down").
#   - You can set the value of a parameter using `this.set("...", value)`.
#   - Using `_annuity` indicates that this parameter is "private": It cannot be set from the outside like normal
#     parameters (IESopt will error if a user tries to) and can only be used by functions like below.
#   - The `prepare` function is called before any components are constructed from this template; this allows accessing
#     the total `capex` and `lifetime`, using them together with the `annuity(...)` function in `IESU` (which is just
#     a quality-of-life renaming of `IESopt.Utilities`) to calculate the annuity, and finally setting the value of
#     the parameter `_annuity` - which is then used in the `invest` (Decision) component.
#   - `IESU.annuity(...)` will per default already factor in the total time span of the model, properly scaling the
#     annuity for models that do not span a 1hourly-1year model exactly. Refer to its documentation for more info.
#   - We are using a dict-valued parameter (`invest`) here - simply to showcase that this is a possibility. Not using
#     that and relying on simple parameters (like almost everywhere else) is perfectly possible as well!
functions:
  prepare: |
    capex = this.get("invest")["capex"]
    lifetime = this.get("invest")["lifetime"]
    annuity = IESU.annuity(capex; lifetime=lifetime, rate=this.get("wacc"))
    this.set("_annuity", annuity)
