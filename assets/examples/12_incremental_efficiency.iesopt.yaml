# This example extends the unit commitment example to utilize varying efficiencies. This can be used to model
# units running at `min_conversion` to have a low efficiency.

    # Important: Without setting the `min_conversion` parameter, `conversion_at_min` can not be used. Furthermore, while
    #            `min_conversion` seems to be rather straight forward, it is actually complicated as soon as changing efficencies
    #            are involved. This entails that IESopt will automatically recalculate the correct min_conversion based on
    #            the setting of `conversion_at_min`, and will inform you about that with an info log.

    # Important: These efficiencies heavily depend on the unit commitment. If we are running "linear", startup costs are
    #            crucial (otherwise the efficiency will not work as intended!). You can try with much lower startup
    #            costs using a binary unit commitment.
