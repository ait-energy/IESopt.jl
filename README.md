**IESopt** (_Integrated Energy System Optimization_) is a modeling and optimization framework for integrated energy
systems.

It is developed and maintained at the **Center for Energy** at
[AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH](https://www.ait.ac.at/). The framework is designed to support the
optimization of energy systems that are characterized by a high degree of integration between different energy carriers
and sectors. It focuses on offering a modular and adaptable tool for modelers, that does not compromise on performance,
while still being user-friendly. This is enabled by reducing energy system assets to abstract building blocks, that are
supported by specialized implementation, and can be combined into complex systems without the need of a detailed
understanding of mathematical modeling or proficiency in any coding-language.

## Quickstart

To install the package, open a Julia REPL and run `add IESopt` in package mode (hit `]`), or run:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IESopt")
```

You can then run a model using:

```julia
using IESopt: IESopt

model = IESopt.run("config.iesopt.yaml")
```

Check out the [documentation](https://ait-energy.github.io/iesopt/) for examples and more information.
