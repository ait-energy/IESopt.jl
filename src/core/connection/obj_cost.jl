    _connection_obj_cost!(connection::Connection)

Add the (potential) cost of this `connection` to the global objective function.

The `connection.cost` setting introduces a fixed cost of "transportation" to the flow of this `Connection`. It is based
on the directed flow. This means that flows in the "opposite" direction will lead to negative costs:

```math
\sum_{t \in T} \text{flow}_t \cdot \text{cost}_t \cdot \omega_t
```

Here $\omega_t$ is the weight of `Snapshot` `t`.

!!! note "Costs for flows in both directions"
    If you need to apply a cost term to the absolute value of the flow, consider splitting the `Connection` into two
    different ones, in opposing directions, and including `lb = 0`.
