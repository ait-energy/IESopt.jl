  # This is a new type of core component: a Decision. It represents a decision to be made that determines a single,
  # scalar value resulting from choosing a "count" (how many of X we want) and a "size" (how big should each X be). By
  # default it is not associated with any costs, and can only build a single "unit" (count == 1). The only setting that
  # is not pre-initialized with a default value is the maximum size. If we do not specify it, the size will be
  # undbounded.
  build_pipeline:
    type: Decision
    # We now associate a cost with increasing the size of this decision. 0.75 units of pipeline capacity will be built,
    # since that is exactly what the model needs to cover peak demand in the south.
