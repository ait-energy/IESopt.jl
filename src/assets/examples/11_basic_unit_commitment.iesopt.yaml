    #         will change (the startup is not necessary anymore).

  # It could be that the unit produces too much energy. This would normally be handled by various internal safety
  # mechanisms that ensure feasibility. But: These (a) complicate the problem for the solver, and (b) possibly distort
  # our results. It is therefore best to always account for possible (foreseeable) cases. We therefore include an
  # external "market" that just takes all left-over energy (at a "negative price" of 5). Make sure that, if you are
  # interested in negative prices for the generation of (i.e.) electricity that you do not account for something like
  # this, and carefully consider Profile's deviation settings.
  market:
    # Try disabling the market. Since the problem will no longer be feasible (the unit can't cover the peak demand while
    # ramping down in time for Snapshot 5/6), the Profile deviation of `demand` will step in and make the problem
    # feasible again using (automatic) load shedding, which can lead to unwanted results (because it just uses default
    # values and will possibly not reflect the wanted situation). Observe the resulting warning!
