  # This new type of core component is used to connect two nodes (that use the same energy carrier). It can model
  # directional flows, losses, delays, flow limits, and so on. Specifying "capacity" as we do it here, constructs a
  # connection that allows flows with -5 <= flow <= 5. The Nodes that are set as "from" and "to" indicate the direction
  # of the flow; here positive values relate to a flow "from node1 to node2".
