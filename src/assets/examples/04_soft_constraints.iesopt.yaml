# This example demonstrates the effect and use of the inbuilt "constraint safety" feature. This artifically alters
# constraints inside the core components, in order to (hopefully) catch infeasibilities during the optimization run,
# returning a (partially) valid solution as well as an indication where the infeasibility occurs.
# Comments indicate points of this model file that changed compared to the previous examples. All other elements are not
# explained/described anymore. See also: 03_basic_two_nodes.yaml
#
# What does the safety feature do?
# Looking at the result of this optimization (e.g. using `JuMP.solution_summary(model, verbose=true)`), we can see that
# one of the "aux" (auxiliary) variables is not at 0 anymore (here: `connection_flow_aux[conn]`). This indicates that
# an additional 0.25 capacity are needed on the Connection "conn" to make the model feasible. This is also indicated by
# the large increase in the objective value (now being > 2.5e14), which comes from the constraint safety cost.
# 
# Important: After optimizing the model, we can extract the "real" objective value from the solution using:
# `JuMP.value(model.ext[:objective])`. Keep in mind though, that this is the optimum that is achieved using the "fix"
# that the safety feature applies.

      # This parameterizes the cost of utilizing the safety feature. This should be much higher than other costs in the
      # objective function and defaults to 1e15. This, while being a rather safe number - meaning it most likely will not
      # interfer in any wrong way with your model - comes at the cost of numerical instability. This can be handled
      # "properly" by some solvers (like Gurobi) but will negatively impact others (like GLPK). To counter this we can
      # specify a lower cost coefficient here. Consider setting a lower tolerance for these solvers, for example call
      # `JuMP.set_optimizer_attribute(model, "tol_dj", 1e-12)` for GLPK.
