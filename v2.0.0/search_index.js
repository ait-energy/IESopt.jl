Keep in mind that negative flows will induce negative costs, which can be used to model revenues. Further, a bidirectional Connection (if lb < 0, which is the default, or if capacity is used) with a positive cost will lead to negative costs for the reverse flow. If you do not want this, split the Connection into two separate ones, each being unidirectional (with lb: 0). Remember, that these can share the same \"capacity\" (which is then set asub), even when using decision:value or col@file as value.\nloss no in 0 1 - 0 Fractional loss when transferring energy. This loss occurs \"at the destination\", which means that for a loss of 5%, set as loss: 0.05, and considering a Snapshot where the Connection has a flow value of 100, it will \"extract\" 100 from node_from and \"inject\" 95 into node_to. Since the flow variable is given as power, this would, e.g., translate to consuming 200 units of energy at node_from and injecting 190 units at node_to, if the Snapshot duration is 2 hours.\nbuild_priority no numeric - 0 Priority for the build order of components.

This can be useful if this Decision was used in a previous optimization and its value should be fixed to that value in the next optimization (applying it where ever it is used, instead of needing to find all usages). Furthermore, this allows extracting the dual value of the constraint that fixes the value, assisting in approaches like Benders decomposition. Note that this does not change the induced cost in any way.\nfixed_cost no - monetary - This setting activates a \"fixed cost\" component for this decision variable, which requires that the model's problem type allows for binary variables (e.g., MILP). This can be used to model fixed costs that are only incurred if the decision variable is active (e.g., a fixed cost for an investment that is only incurred if the investment is made). If the decision is 0, no fixed costs have to be paid; however, if the decision is greater than 0, the fixed cost is incurred. Note that after deciding to activate the decision, the overall value is still determined in the usual (continuous) way, incuring the (variable) cost as well. More complex cost functions can be modelled by switching to mode sos1 or sos2 and using the sos parameter.\nmode no linear, binary, integer, sos1, sos2, fixed - linear Type of the decision variable that is constructed. linear results in a continuous decision, integer results in a integer variable, binary constrains it to be either 0 or 1. sos1 and sos2 can be used to activate SOS1 or SOS2 mode (used for piecewise linear costs).

Use fixed if you want to fix the value of the Profile to a specific value, e.g., a given energy demand. Use create to \"import\" energy into the model, e.g., from a not explicitly modelled gas market, indcucing a certain cost for buying that energy. Use destroy to \"export\" energy from the model, e.g., to handle CO2 going into the atmosphere (which may be taxed, etc., by the cost of this Profile).

Specified in the form of \"alpha cdot carrier_1 + beta cdot carrier_2 -> gamma cdot carrier_3 + delta cdot carrier_4\". Coefficients allow simple numerical calculations, but are not allowed to include spaces (so e.g. (1.0/9.0) is valid). Coefficients are allowed to be NumericalInputs, resulting in column@data_file being a valid coefficient (this can be used e.g. for time-varying COPs of heatpumps).\ncapacity yes value dir:carrier - - Maximum capacity of this Unit, to be given in the format X in/out:carrier where X is the amount, in or out (followed by :) specifies whether the limit is to be placed on the in- our output of this Unit, and carrier specifies the respective Carrier. Example: 100 in:electricity (to limit the \"input rating\").\noutputs yes dict - - Dictionary specifying the output \"ports\" of this Unit. Refer to the basic examples for the general syntax.\ninputs no dict - - Dictionary specifying the input \"ports\" of this Unit. If not specified (= no explicit input), the conversion has to follow the form of conversion: ~ -> ..., indicating an \"open\" input. This may, e.g., be used for renewable energy sources, where the primary energy input (e.g., solar) is not explicitly modeled.\navailability no numeric power +infty Time series (or fixed value) that limits the available capacity. If, e.g., capacity: 100 out:electricity and availability: 70, the available capacity will only be 70 electricity. Can be used to model non-availability of power plants, e.g., due to maintenance. For time-varying availability of intermittent generators (e.g., wind), it's recommended (most of the time) to use availability_factor instead.\navailability_factor no in 0 1 - 1 Similar to availability, but given as factor of capacity instead. If, e.g., capacity: 100 out:electricity and availability_factor: 0.7, the available capacity will only be 70 electricity. This is especially useful for intermittent generators, where the availability is not a fixed value, but depends on the weather, and can be passed, e.g., by setting availability_factor: wind@input_data_file.\nadapt_min_to_availability no true, false - false If true, the minimal partial load will be influenced by the availability. Example: Consider a Unit with capacity: 100 out:electricity, a min_conversion of 0.4, and an availability_factor of 0.5. This entails having 50 electricity available, while the minimal partial load is 40 electricity. This results in the Unit at best operating only closely above the minimal partial load. Furthermore, an availability_factor below 0.4 would result in no feasible generation, besides shutting the Unit off. While this might be the intended mode of operation in many use cases, adapt_min_to_availability can change this: If set to true, this dynamically changes the minimal partial load. In the previous example, that means (100 * 0.5) * 0.4 = 20 electricity (the 50% minimum load are now based on the available 40), changing the overall behaviour (including efficiencies) as well as leading to feasible generations even when the availability_factor is below 0.4.\nmarginal_cost no value per dir:carrier monetary per energy 0 Marginal cost of the consumption/generation of one unit of energy of the specified carrier. Has to be given in the format value per dir:carrier, e.g. 3.5 per out:electricity for a marginal cost of 3.5 monetary units per unit of electricity generated.\nenable_ramp_up no true, false - false Enables calculation of upward ramps. Ramping is based on the carrier specified in capacity.\nenable_ramp_down no true, false - false Enables calculation of downward ramps. Ramping is based on the carrier specified in capacity.\nramp_up_cost no numeric monetary per power 0 Sets the cost of ramping up (increasing in-/output) by 1 unit of the capacity carrier.\nramp_down_cost no numeric monetary per power 0 Sets the cost of ramping down (decreasing in-/output) by 1 unit of the capacity carrier.\nramp_up_limit no in 0 1 - 1 Limits the allowed ramping up based on this factor of the total capacity. If capacity: 100 in:electricity with ramp_up_limit: 0.2, this limits the total increase of usage of electricity (on the input) to 20 units (power) per hour. For example, starting at an input of 35, after one hour the input has to be lesser than or equal to 55. If a Snapshot's duration is set to, e.g., two hours, this would allow a total increase of 40 units.\nramp_down_limit no in 0 1 - 1 Limits the allowed ramping down based on this factor of the total capacity. See ramp_up_limit.\nmin_on_time no numeric hours 0 Minimum on-time of the Unit. If set, the Unit has to be on for at least this amount of time, after turning on. It is highly recommended to only use this with unit_commitment: binary, unless you know why it's fine to use with another mode.\nmin_off_time no numeric hours 0 Minimum off-time of the Unit. If set, the Unit has to be off for at least this amount of time, after turning off. It is highly recommended to only use this with unit_commitment: binary, unless you know why it's fine to use with another mode.\non_time_before no numeric hours 0 Time that this Unit has already been running before the optimization starts. Can be used in combination with min_on_time.\noff_time_before no numeric hours 0 Time that this Unit has already been off before the optimization starts. Can be used in combination with min_off_time.\nis_on_before no numeric - 1 Number of Units that should be considered to have been running before the optimization starts. Can be used in combination with on_time_before, especially for unit_count greater than 1.\nunit_commitment no off, linear, binary, integer - off Controls how the unit commitment of this Unit is handled. linear results in the ability to startup parts of the unit (so 0.314159 is a feasible amount of \"turned on unit\"), while binary restricts the Unit to either be on (converting the conversion_at_min + possible additional conversion above that minimum) or off (converting nothing); integer is needed to consider binary unit commitment for Units with more than 1 \"grouped unit\" (see unit_count).\nunit_count no numeric - 1 Number of units aggregated in this Unit. Besides interacting with the mode of unit_commitment, this mainly is responsible for scaling the output (e.g. grouping 47 of the same wind turbine, ...).\nmin_conversion no in 0 1 - - If unit_commitment is not set to off, this specifies the percentage that is considered to be the minimal feasible partial load this Unit can operate at. Operating below that setpoint is not allowed, at that point the conversion_at_min coefficients are used, and above that they are scaled to result in conversion when running at full capacity.\nconversion_at_min no string - - The conversion expression while running on the minimal partial load. Only applicable if unit_commitment is not off and min_conversion is explicitly set. Follows the same form as conversion.\nstartup_cost no numeric monetary per start 0 Costs per startup (also applicable if startups are not binary or integer). This is necessary to allow conversion_at_min to have (at least partially) the effect that one expects, if unit_commitment: linear.\nbuild_priority no numeric - 0 Priority for the build order of components.

This can be used to model fixed costs that are only incurred if the decision variable is active (e.g., a fixed cost for an investment that is only incurred if the investment is made). If the decision is 0, no fixed costs have to be paid; however, if the decision is greater than 0, the fixed cost is incurred.

Specified in the form of \"alpha cdot carrier_1 + beta cdot carrier_2 -> gamma cdot carrier_3 + delta cdot carrier_4\". Coefficients allow simple numerical calculations, but are not allowed to include spaces (so e.g. (1.0/9.0) is valid). Coefficients are allowed to be NumericalInputs, resulting in column@data_file being a valid coefficient (this can be used e.g. for time-varying COPs of heatpumps).\ncapacity yes value dir:carrier - - Maximum capacity of this Unit, to be given in the format X in/out:carrier where X is the amount, in or out (followed by :) specifies whether the limit is to be placed on the in- our output of this Unit, and carrier specifies the respective Carrier. Example: 100 in:electricity (to limit the \"input rating\").\noutputs yes dict - - Dictionary specifying the output \"ports\" of this Unit. Refer to the basic examples for the general syntax.\ninputs no dict - - Dictionary specifying the input \"ports\" of this Unit. If not specified (= no explicit input), the conversion has to follow the form of conversion: ~ -> ..., indicating an \"open\" input. This may, e.g., be used for renewable energy sources, where the primary energy input (e.g., solar) is not explicitly modeled.\navailability no numeric power +infty Time series (or fixed value) that limits the available capacity. If, e.g., capacity: 100 out:electricity and availability: 70, the available capacity will only be 70 electricity. Can be used to model non-availability of power plants, e.g., due to maintenance. For time-varying availability of intermittent generators (e.g., wind), it's recommended (most of the time) to use availability_factor instead.\navailability_factor no in 0 1 - 1 Similar to availability, but given as factor of capacity instead. If, e.g., capacity: 100 out:electricity and availability_factor: 0.7, the available capacity will only be 70 electricity. This is especially useful for intermittent generators, where the availability is not a fixed value, but depends on the weather, and can be passed, e.g., by setting availability_factor: wind@input_data_file.\nadapt_min_to_availability no true, false - false If true, the minimal partial load will be influenced by the availability. Example: Consider a Unit with capacity: 100 out:electricity, a min_conversion of 0.4, and an availability_factor of 0.5. This entails having 50 electricity available, while the minimal partial load is 40 electricity. This results in the Unit at best operating only closely above the minimal partial load. Furthermore, an availability_factor below 0.4 would result in no feasible generation, besides shutting the Unit off. While this might be the intended mode of operation in many use cases, adapt_min_to_availability can change this: If set to true, this dynamically changes the minimal partial load. In the previous example, that means (100 * 0.5) * 0.4 = 20 electricity (the 50% minimum load are now based on the available 40), changing the overall behaviour (including efficiencies) as well as leading to feasible generations even when the availability_factor is below 0.4.\nmarginal_cost no value per dir:carrier monetary per energy 0 Marginal cost of the consumption/generation of one unit of energy of the specified carrier. Has to be given in the format value per dir:carrier, e.g. 3.5 per out:electricity for a marginal cost of 3.5 monetary units per unit of electricity generated.\nenable_ramp_up no true, false - false Enables calculation of upward ramps. Ramping is based on the carrier specified in capacity.\nenable_ramp_down no true, false - false Enables calculation of downward ramps. Ramping is based on the carrier specified in capacity.\nramp_up_cost no numeric monetary per power 0 Sets the cost of ramping up (increasing in-/output) by 1 unit of the capacity carrier.\nramp_down_cost no numeric monetary per power 0 Sets the cost of ramping down (decreasing in-/output) by 1 unit of the capacity carrier.\nramp_up_limit no in 0 1 - 1 Limits the allowed ramping up based on this factor of the total capacity. If capacity: 100 in:electricity with ramp_up_limit: 0.2, this limits the total increase of usage of electricity (on the input) to 20 units (power) per hour. For example, starting at an input of 35, after one hour the input has to be lesser than or equal to 55. If a Snapshot's duration is set to, e.g., two hours, this would allow a total increase of 40 units.\nramp_down_limit no in 0 1 - 1 Limits the allowed ramping down based on this factor of the total capacity. See ramp_up_limit.\nmin_on_time no numeric hours 0 Minimum on-time of the Unit. If set, the Unit has to be on for at least this amount of time, after turning on. It is highly recommended to only use this with unit_commitment: binary, unless you know why it's fine to use with another mode.\nmin_off_time no numeric hours 0 Minimum off-time of the Unit. If set, the Unit has to be off for at least this amount of time, after turning off. It is highly recommended to only use this with unit_commitment: binary, unless you know why it's fine to use with another mode.\non_time_before no numeric hours 0 Time that this Unit has already been running before the optimization starts. Can be used in combination with min_on_time.\noff_time_before no numeric hours 0 Time that this Unit has already been off before the optimization starts. Can be used in combination with min_off_time.\nis_on_before no numeric - 1 Number of Units that should be considered to have been running before the optimization starts. Can be used in combination with on_time_before, especially for unit_count greater than 1.\nunit_commitment no off, linear, binary, integer - off Controls how the unit commitment of this Unit is handled. linear results in the ability to startup parts of the unit (so 0.314159 is a feasible amount of \"turned on unit\"), while binary restricts the Unit to either be on (converting the conversion_at_min + possible additional conversion above that minimum) or off (converting nothing); integer is needed to consider binary unit commitment for Units with more than 1 \"grouped unit\" (see unit_count).\nunit_count no numeric - 1 Number of units aggregated in this Unit. Besides interacting with the mode of unit_commitment, this mainly is responsible for scaling the output (e.g. grouping 47 of the same wind turbine, ...).\nmin_conversion no in 0 1 - - If unit_commitment is not set to off, this specifies the percentage that is considered to be the minimal feasible partial load this Unit can operate at. Operating below that setpoint is not allowed, at that point the conversion_at_min coefficients are used, and above that they are scaled to result in conversion when running at full capacity.\nconversion_at_min no string - - The conversion expression while running on the minimal partial load. Only applicable if unit_commitment is not off and min_conversion is explicitly set. Follows the same form as conversion.\nstartup_cost no numeric monetary per start 0 Costs per startup (also applicable if startups are not binary or integer). This is necessary to allow conversion_at_min to have (at least partially) the effect that one expects, if unit_commitment: linear.\nbuild_priority no numeric - 0 Priority for the build order of components.
